            //    However, this way we copy data around more than is necessary. If elements are big
            //    structures (costly to copy), this method will be slow.
            //
            // 2. Iterate until the right place for the first element is found. Then shift the
            //    elements succeeding it to make room for it and finally place it into the
            //    remaining hole. This is a good method.
            //
            // 3. Copy the first element into a temporary variable. Iterate until the right place
            //    for it is found. As we go along, copy every traversed element into the slot
            //    preceding it. Finally, copy data from the temporary variable into the remaining
            //    hole. This method is very good. Benchmarks demonstrated slightly better
            //    performance than with the 2nd method.

            // 2. Fills the remaining hole in `v` in the end.
