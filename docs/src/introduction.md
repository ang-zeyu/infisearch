# Introduction

InfiSearch is a *client-side* search solution made for static sites, including a search UI and library depending on a *pre-built index* generated by a CLI tool.

## Features

- **Relevant Search** üîç: spelling correction, automatic prefix search, boolean and phrase queries, BM25 scoring, proximity scoring, facet filters and more...

- **Speedy** üèá: WebAssembly & WebWorker powered, enabling efficient, non-blocking query processing. Also includes persistent caching to minimize network requests, and a multi-threaded  CLI indexer powered by Rust.

- **Semi-Scalable**, achieved by optionally splitting the index into tiny morsels, complete with incremental indexing.

- A **customisable**, **accessible** [user interface](https://infi-search.com/infisearch/search_configuration_styling.html) üñ•Ô∏è

- Support for **multiple file formats** (`.json,csv,pdf,html`) to satisfy more custom data requirements.

### Search Features

A little more about some of InfiSearch's search features.

#### Ranking Model

Query expressions are ranked using the BM25 model. A soft disjunctive maximum of a document's field's scores is then calculated. By default, titles, `<h1>` headings, other headings, and the rest of the text are indexed into 4 separate fields.

**Query term proximity ranking** is InfiSearch's highlight here, and is enabled by default. Results are scaled according to how close search expressions are to one another, greatly improving search relevance.

#### Built-In Compression

Some efficient, high-return compression schemes are also employed, so you get all these features without much penalty.
To facilitate decompression efficiency of such a low-level format, most of the search library is also powered by WebAssembly (Rust).

This documentation for example, which has all features enabled, generates a main index file of just 19KB, and a dictionary of 9KB.

#### WebWorker Built-in

Most of the search library also operates on a WebWorker, so you can deliver the best UX without blocking the UI thread, especially for large collections.

#### Persistent Caching

Persistent caching is achieved through use of the [Cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) API, which backs service workers and has excellent support in modern browsers.

## How it Works:

InfiSearch depends on a static, pre-built index that is a collection of various files.

1. The CLI indexer tool first generates:
   - Binary index chunk(s)
   - JSON field store(s) containing raw document texts
   - Supporting metadata, for example the search dictionary
1. The search UI:
   1. Figures out which index files are needed from the user query
   1. Retrieves the index files from cache/memory/network requests
   1. Obtains and ranks the result set
   1. Finally, retrieves the field stores from cache/memory/network requests progressively to generate result previews
