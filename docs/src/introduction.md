# Introduction

Morsels is a complete client-side search solution tailored for static sites, including a search *user interface and library* that depends on a *pre-built index* generated by a *command-line* tool.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded** 🏇 CLI indexer powered by Rust

- **Typo tolerance** ⌨ with spelling correction and automatic prefix search

- **Feature-rich search** 🔍: boolean queries, field filters, phrase queries, BM25 scoring, query term proximity boosts, persistent caching and WebWorker built-in

- Powered by **WebAssembly**, enabling efficient index (de)compression and query processing 

- **Semi-Scalable** 📈, achieved by (optionally) splitting the index into chunks ("morsels").

- **Incremental** Indexing

- **Customisable** and **Accessible** dropdown / fullscreen popup user interface 🖥️

## Use Cases

You may want to use this tool if:
- You want a complete solution for static site search
- You have a collection of HTML, CSV, JSON, PDF or TXT (only these are supported for now) files on disk to index
- Running a search server / SaaS (eg. Algolia Docsearch) is not an option

> ⚠️ 
> It is **not possible** to use morsels for **client-side indexing** since the indexer is a cli tool.
>
> If this is the use case, consider other lighter-weight libraries like lunr.js that already fit well.

## Other Notes

1. **Wasm** is used -- that means no IE support =(

1. **Not production ready!**

1. **Browser Focused**: For now, the focus is static site search. That means no Node.js support and such.
