# Introduction

Morsels is a complete client-side search solution tailored for static sites, including a search *user interface and library* that depends on a *pre-built index* generated by a *command-line* tool.

## Features

- **Multi-threaded** 🏇 CLI indexer powered by Rust

- **Typo tolerance** ⌨ with spelling correction and automatic prefix search

- **Feature-rich search** 🔍: boolean queries, field filters, phrase queries, BM25 scoring, query term proximity boosts, persistent caching and WebWorker built-in

- Powered by **WebAssembly**, enabling efficient index (de)compression and query processing 

- **Semi-Scalable** 📈, achieved by (optionally) splitting the index into chunks ("morsels").

- **Incremental** Indexing

- **Customisable** and **Accessible** dropdown / fullscreen popup user interface 🖥️

## Use Cases

You may want to use this tool if:
- You want a complete solution for static site search
- You have a fairly **large collection** of HTML, CSV, JSON, PDF or text (only these are supported for now) files that cannot be monolithically retrieved or kept in memory feasibly
- Running a search server / SaaS (eg. Algolia Docsearch) is not an option

> ⚠️ 
> It is **not possible** to use morsels for **client-side indexing** since the indexer is a cli tool.
>
> If this is the use case, consider other lighter-weight libraries like lunr.js that already fit well.

## How it Works:

## Other Limitations

1. **Latency** & File Bloat (*only if* fragmenting the index)

   Scaling this tool for larger collections necessitates fragmenting the index and **retrieving only what's needed** when searched, which means extra network requests, but to a reasonable degree. (see this [demo](https://ang-zeyu.github.io/morsels-demo-1/))

   This tool should be able to handle `800MB` **pure text** (not counting things like HTML soup) collections with the full set of features enabled and some configuration tweaking.

   The degree of fragmentation can be [configured](https://ang-zeyu.github.io/morsels/presets.html) to varying degrees. That is, by default, Morsels can, and does function much like other existing monolithic pre-built index options in terms of the number of network requests, and you only "pay for what you need".

2. **Wasm** -- no IE support =(

3. **Not production ready!**

4. **Browser Focused**: For now, the focus is on providing e2e search functionalities in the browser. That means no Node.js support and such.
