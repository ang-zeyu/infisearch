# Introduction

Morsels is a client-side search solution made for static sites, including a search UI and library that depends on a pre-built index generated by a command-line tool.

## Features

- **Feature-rich, Relevant Search** 🔍: spelling correction, automatic prefix search, boolean and phrase queries, BM25 scoring, proximity scoring, persistent caching, ...

- **WebAssembly** & **WebWorker** powered, enabling efficient, non-blocking index decompression and query processing

- **Multi-threaded** 🏇 CLI indexer powered by Rust

- **Semi-Scalable** 📈, achieved by (optionally) splitting the index into tiny morsels, complete with incremental indexing.

- A **customisable**, **accessible** [user interface](https://morsels-search.com/morsels/search_configuration_styling.html) 🖥️

## Use Cases

You may want to use this tool if:
- You want a complete solution for static site search
- You have a collection of HTML, CSV, JSON, PDF or TXT files on disk to index
- Running a search server / SaaS (eg. Algolia Docsearch) is not an option

> ⚠️ 
> It is **not possible** to use morsels for **client-side indexing** since the indexer is a cli tool.
>
> If this is the use case, consider other lighter-weight libraries like lunr.js that already fit well.

## How it Works:

The following is a quick high level breakdown of how Morsels works:

1. The CLI indexer tool generates:
   - Binary index files
   - JSON field stores (raw document texts)
   - Supporting metadata (e.g. search dictionary)
1. The search UI, which consists a JS file and WebAssembly binary:
   1. Figures out which index files are needed from the user query
   1. Retrieves the index files from cache/memory/network requests
   1. Obtains and ranks the result set
   1. Finally, retrieves the field stores from cache/memory/network requests progressively to generate result previews to show to the user!

## Other Notes

1. **Wasm** is used -- that means no IE support =(

1. **Browser Focused**: The focus is static site search. That means no Node.js support and such.
