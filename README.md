# Morsels.`j/rs`

![CI workflow](https://github.com/ang-zeyu/morsels/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A complete and more scalable pre-built index approach to client-side search.

## Description

Morsels is a complete **client-side** search solution tailored for static sites, including a search **user interface and library** that depends on a **pre-built index** generated by a **command-line build tool**.

The secondary value proposition versus other pre-built index alternatives is the option of scalability, achieved mainly by splitting the index into many smaller chunks ("morsels"). This allows the client to retrieve and load only what is searched, circumventing network (loading times) & device memory constraints imposed by a monolithic index.

## Features

- Multi-threaded CLI indexer powered by Rust
- WebWorker built-in: no more hanging UI threads
- Disjunctive expression scoring using BM25
- Standard search features, such as boolean queries and field filters
- Positional search features: phrase queries, and query term proximity boosts
- Persistent client side caching
- Powered by WebAssembly, enabling efficient index decompression and query processing 
- Gap and Variable integer compression, giving you more *bang-per-byte*
- Incremental indexing
- Customisable dropdown / fullscreen user interface

## Use Cases

The main target use case for this tool right now is providing a complete search solution for static sites (and possibly really, really large ones) or static site generators.

That said, the indexing tool was built with support for a few other file formats (`.json`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.txt`) in mind, and might be useful elsewhere as such.

## Getting Started

Powering static site search requires just a folder of your HTML files! Titles, links, headings, etc. are automatically sourced.

Please check out the [documentation](http://ang-zeyu.github.io/morsels/getting_started.html), which also uses Morsels for its search function.

## Demo

A simple, punishing demo on a 500MB, 52000 document Gutenberg collection subcorpus is also available [here](https://ang-zeyu.github.io/morsels-demo-1/).
