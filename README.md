## Use Cases

The main target use case for this tool right now is providing a complete and feature-rich, but efficient search solution for static sites or static site generators.

The indexing tool supports a few other file formats (`.json`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.html`) as well, which can help support more custom data requirements (e.g. linking to another domain).

## Getting Started

Powering static site search requires just a folder of your HTML files! Titles, links, headings, etc. are automatically sourced.

Please check out the [documentation](https://morsels-search.com/morsels/getting_started.html), which also uses Morsels for its search function.

A much heavier demo on a 500MB, 52000 document Gutenberg collection subcorpus is also available [here](https://morsels-search.com).
