# Morsels.`j/rs` ðŸ§€

A more scalable pre-built index approach to client-side search.

---

## Description

Morsels is a **client-side** search **user interface and library** that depends on a **pre-built index** generated by a **command-line build tool**.

The main value proposition here versus other pre-built index options is the splitting of this index to many smaller chunks ("morsels"), which enables the client to retrieve and load only what it needs when searched. This avoids blowing up network and memory usage immediately on startup.

## Features

- Multi-threaded command-line indexer powered by Rust
- WebWorker / WebAssembly (Rust) powered search
- Standard set of boolean, phrase query syntax
- Customisable dropdown / fullscreen popup user interface
- A plugin for mdbook!
